iOS Augmented Reality using Cocos2d v 2.x Tutorial

This project was created to assist in a tutorial about using an iPhone camera with Cocos2d v2.x.  This project creates a simple Cocos2d project that uses the iPhone device camera input as the background and allows a developer to place Cocos2d layers over it.  This can be used to make a HUD or augmented reality iOS app.
